# Some important information

I use kali as my attack machine so if you use a different flavor (os) of linux your syntax may or may not
be different then mine. The IP addresses I show in my write ups for both the target machine and the 
attacker machine will be different from yours and you will have to replace the IP's for nmap,netcat, web browser etc. 
to your attacker IP and target IP.
