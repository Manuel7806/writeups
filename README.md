# Some important information

I use kali as my attack machine so if you use a different flavor (os) of linux your syntax may or may not
be different then mine. The IP addresses I show in my write ups for both the target machine and the 
attacker machine will be different from yours and you will have to replace the IP's for nmap,netcat, web browser etc. 
to your attacker IP and target IP.

# About Me

I would say I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate with my level of knowledge. I am learning something new
everyday, I don't hope to be the best I just hope to be better today than I was yesterday. I am self taught through
what I can find on the internet via youtube, blogs, articles etc. and books. I started my journey into ethical hacking
about 3/4 months ago and feel as if I have learned quit a bit like I said I don't aim to be the best just better than
I was yesterday. I have to say that I owe a lot of my learning from ippsec, john hammond, david bombal, and many more,
If you haven't seen any of there videos I would highly recommend them. I will link a few of there channels down below.
I am open to helping if anybody needs help but also keep in mind that I don't know everything there is to know about
ethical hacking, linux, etc., but that doesn't mean that I won't try and help you figure out a solution to your problem.
