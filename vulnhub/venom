To begin I ran a nmap scan to see the available ports that I can access

#nmap command

sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/scan 10.0.2.251


# nmap results

I saw that it was running samba so I used enum4linux to see if I could find any shares or users on the computer
I didn't find any shares that I could access but I did find 2 users

# enum4linux command

enum4linux -a 10.0.2.251


# enum4linux results

I then ran gobuster to see if there were any hidden directories that I could find and found nothing more than the index page

I went to the index page in the browser and it was the default apache page but at the bottom of the page was a text that 
said "follow this to get access on somewhere.....-->", so I viewed the page source code and got another string that looks 
to be a md5 hash "<5f2a66f947fa5690c26506f66bde5c23>"

The md5 hash decoded to be "hostinger"

I tried to login to ftp with the user nathan and I got a access denied so I tried with hostinger user and was prompt
for their password, I used their username for the password and was able to login to ftp using hostinger:hostinger

On the ftp server there is a file called hint.txt so I downloaded it

Here are the contents of hint.txt

Hey there... 

T0D0 --

* You need to follow the 'hostinger' on WXpOU2FHSnRVbWhqYlZGblpHMXNibHBYTld4amJWVm5XVEpzZDJGSFZuaz0= also aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdGlpLmNvbS9waXBlcy92aWdlbmVyZS1jaXBoZXI=
* some knowledge of cipher is required to decode the dora password..
* try on venom.box
password -- L7f9l8@J#p%Ue+Q1234 -> decode this you will get the administrator password 


Have fun .. :)

Seeing that the hint points at venom.box I added the IP and venom.box to my /etc/hosts file

After adding venom.box to /etc/hosts and visiting it in the web browser I got a different page than before

After decoding the first base64 string three times I got this string "standard vigenere cipher"

The second base64 encoded string decoded to a url that looks to be a cipher decoder https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher

After decoding the cipher using "hostinger" as the key I went to the admin panel and tried to login with hostinger:E7r9t8@Q#h%Hy+M1234
and was unsuccessful so I tried the username dora and was able to login to the admin panel

Seeing that is was using Subrion 4.2 cms I looked for known exploits and found several of them


# NOTES ABOUT THE IMAGE FILE UPLOAD
After messing around for a bit I found that you can upload a image file as a avatar but they only allow
gif,jpg,jpeg and png files to be used. Trying to see if there is a way to bypass the image upload and get a rce on the server

It seems as if they are checking the extensions of the file but not the actual data of the image file
I just can't seem to get it to run code, when I upload the file and then go to visit the "image" file in the browser I 
get a 404 error

After messing with the image file upload and getting nowhere I decided to move one and found a file upload that doesn't
restrict .phar files and was able to upload a reverse shell from there

After getting a reverse shell I was able to escalate to "hostinger" user using their username as the password

Checking the "hostinger" users .bash_history revealed that he was reading a file in /var/www/html/subrion/backup/.htaccess
in the file was a string that said "you will be happy now" along with a long string of random letters/numbers 
"FzN+f2-rRaBgvALzj*Rk#_JJYfg8XfKhxqB82x_a", with that I was able to escelate to the "nathan" user

After getting the "nathan" user I was able to read the user flag

# user flag

W3_@r3_V3n0m:P

As the "nathan" user I was able to run any command as root other than su, so I just used python to escalate to root

# python command to git root

sudo python -c "import os; os.system('/bin/bash')"


Once I was root I was able to read the root flag

# root flag
H@v3_a_n1c3_l1fe.
